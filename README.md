# pdf-rename

A simple script to parse dates from pdfs and rename them with a date prefix and a keyword (which is downloaded from a gist).
Run the script inside the folder with the pdfs you want to rename.


*! Attention:* This renames and moves your files. Be sure to have backups of the data you're working on.


## Roadmap

* Further refinement of the date-patterns
* pdf-rename as module
* Better integration of keywords
